# How to architect and choose the best solution?

1. Figure out what the factors that are important to the organization are (it's rarely "cheapest possible" or "latest hype" option)

    1. If it is an improvement to an existing product, think about the existing project stakeholders and how the change will affect them
    
    2. If it is a new project, think about how the product will be used in production

2. Define and compare several approaches, follow [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)

3. You might want to follow [Well-Architected Framework](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/index.en.html) but take it with a grain of salt, use [YAGNI principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it)

# Creating Disaster Recovery plans

1. Collect requirements like SLA documents

2. Determine what is a disaster. It can be a natural disaster, failure of hardware, your on-prem DC or an attack

3. Determine [recovery time objective (RTO)](https://www.ibm.com/services/business-continuity/rto) and your [recovery point objective (RPO)](https://www.ibm.com/services/business-continuity/rpo)

4. Talk with business to balance costs vs risks in the DR plans

5. Write plans and if possible, automate, chaos engineering can be here helpful
