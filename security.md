1. Use [IAM Policy Simulator](https://policysim.aws.amazon.com/) to simulate evaluation

# How can I make cloud security audits?
1. Use free tools like [prowler](https://github.com/toniblyx/prowler) for audit or [Cloud Custodian](https://cloudcustodian.io/docs/index.html) for compliance
2. [https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub](AWS Security Hub) can be overcomplicated but works
